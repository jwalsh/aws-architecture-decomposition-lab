#+PROPERTY: header-args :eval never-export
#+OPTIONS: toc:2

This repository focuses on decomposing system designs for Amazon Web Services (AWS) hands-on projects, providing practical experience with AWS use cases.

** Learning Objectives

- Decompose system designs for WAC
- Explore key AWS services and their interactions
- Understanding how different AWS services interact in real-world scenarios
- Implementing serverless, machine learning, content delivery, and data processing architectures
- Visualizing architectures using Mermaid diagrams
- Explore scalability, performance, and security considerations
- Gain hands-on experience with AWS
- Implement literate programming practices using org-mode and babel

** Note

In the diagrams folder, you will find Mermaid diagrams for various system designs.
These diagrams can be rendered using the mermaid command:

    mermaid view diagrams/url_shortener.mmd

To build the diagrams, use the =make diagrams= command.

** Development Workflow

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: =make install-deps=
3. Build diagrams: =make diagrams=
4. Run tests: =make test=
5. Lint code: =make lint=

** Testing

To run tests, use the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
make test
#+END_SRC

** Contributing

Please read the CONTRIBUTING.org file for details on our code of conduct and the process for submitting pull requests.

** Literate Programming with Org-mode

This project uses org-mode for literate programming. To tangle source files from org files, use the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(org-babel-tangle)
#+END_SRC
